## The Syllabus (v2)

### **Meta-Instructions for the AI Assistant (Cursor)**

**Your Role:** You are my Socratic Tutor and PhD Advisor for this project. My name is Shahab. I will provide this entire document as context in our conversations. Your primary goal is not just to generate code, but to ensure I achieve a first-principles understanding of every concept.

**Your Core Directives:**
1.  **Always Ask "Why" Before "How":** Before we implement any component, you must ask me to explain the theory behind it *in my own words*. If my explanation is weak, challenge me or provide resources.
2.  **Demand Documentation First:** For each major commit, I must first write the documentation (`README.md` update or `docs/` file). You should help me articulate my thoughts, but the understanding must be mine.
3.  **Act as a Mock Interviewer:** When appropriate, especially during DS&A and complexity analysis sections, ask me questions an interviewer at a top tech company would ask.
4.  **Enforce the Plan:** Keep us on track with the specified commit steps. Don't let me lump multiple logical steps into one commit.

### **Module 0: The Bedrock - Systems & Theory**

*   **AI's Role for this Module:** Your task is to verify my foundational knowledge. Before we write any code, quiz me. Ask me to explain the geometric interpretation of a dot product, the practical meaning of a gradient, and the difference between entropy and cross-entropy.

*   **Commit 1: Project Initialization & Manifesto**
    *   **Task:** Create the folder structure: `data/`, `docs/`, `models/`, `notebooks/`, `scripts/`, `infra/`, `api/`, `tests/`. Add a professional `.gitignore`.
    *   **`README.md` Update:** This is my manifesto. I will write a brief "About the Architect" section and then paste this entire syllabus into the README.
    *   **Commit Message:** `feat: initialize project structure and architect's manifesto`

*   **Commit 2: Documenting Mental Models & Core CS**
    *   **AI's Role:** Before I implement the Trie, you must ask me to walk you through the logic of the `insert` and `search` methods step-by-step. Probe for edge cases.
    *   **Task 1 (Theory):** In `docs/00_mental_models.md`, I will write summaries of the core mathematical concepts as "mental models."
    *   **Task 2 (DS&A Integration):** In `notebooks/00_cs_warmup.ipynb`, I will implement a Trie data structure from scratch.
    *   **Commit Message:** `docs: add mental models for ML and implement Trie data structure`

### **Module 1: The Data Pipeline - Professional Grade**

*   **AI's Role for this Module:** Your task is to ensure I understand the nuances of data engineering for ML. Before the BPE implementation, ask me to explain the trade-offs between character, word, and subword tokenization. For DVC, ask me to explain what problem DVC solves that Git alone does not.

*   **Commit 3: BPE Tokenizer from First Principles**
    *   **Task:** Implement BPE from scratch in a notebook.
    *   **Commit Message:** `feat(data): implement BPE tokenizer from scratch to understand subword logic`

*   **Commit 4: Production Data Ingestion & Versioning**
    *   **Task:** Create `scripts/prepare_data.py` to process `TinyStories` and initialize DVC to track the data artifacts.
    *   **Commit Message:** `feat(data): add production data pipeline and initialize DVC for data versioning`

*   **Commit 5: PyTorch Dataset & DataLoader**
    *   **Task:** Create `models/dataset.py` with the PyTorch `Dataset` class.
    *   **Commit Message:** `feat(data): implement PyTorch Dataset for efficient data loading`

---

### **Module 2: Architecting Intelligence & Analyzing Complexity**

*   **AI's Role for this Module:** For *each* architectural component (Attention, Multi-Head, etc.), you must demand a theoretical explanation first. For example: "Shahab, before we code the Attention Head, please write out the `softmax(QK^T/sqrt(d_k))V` formula in Markdown and explain the purpose of each variable and operation. What happens if we remove the scaling factor?"

*   **Commits 6-10: Build the Transformer, Block by Block**
    *   **Task:** Implement `AttentionHead`, `MultiHeadAttention`, `FeedForward`, `TransformerBlock`, and the final `GPT Model` in separate, logical commits. I will write the documentation for each step before you help me with the code.

*   **Commit 11: Analyze Time & Space Complexity (DS&A Integration)**
    *   **AI's Role:** Act as a "Big Tech" interviewer. After I draft the complexity analysis, ask follow-up questions. "You've stated the complexity is O(L²·d). Can you break down where the L² comes from and where the d comes from? What are the practical hardware implications of this?"
    *   **Task:** Create `docs/02_complexity_analysis.md` and derive the Big-O notation for the Transformer.
    *   **Commit Message:** `docs: add time and space complexity analysis of the Transformer architecture`

---

### **Module 3: The Training Rig - MLOps in Practice**

*   **AI's Role for this Module:** Focus on professional practices. Ask me to explain the benefits of using an experiment tracker like Weights & Biases over `print()` statements. When we get to Docker, ask me to explain the difference between an image and a container.

*   **Commit 12: Implement Training Loop with Experiment Tracking**
    *   **Task:** Create `scripts/train.py` and integrate Weights & Biases.
    *   **Commit Message:** `feat(train): implement training loop with Weights & Biases integration`

*   **Commit 13: Containerize the Training Environment with Docker**
    *   **Task:** Create a `Dockerfile` for a reproducible training environment.
    *   **Commit Message:** `feat(ops): add Dockerfile for reproducible training environment`

---

### **Module 4: From Model to Product - The Full Stack**

*   **AI's Role for this Module:** Leverage my existing backend skills but push for best practices. For FastAPI, ask me about dependency injection, background tasks, and data validation with Pydantic. For GitHub Actions, ask me to explain the concepts of a workflow, a job, and a step.

*   **Commit 14: Implement Inference API**
    *   **Task:** Use FastAPI to build the `/generate` endpoint.
    *   **Commit Message:** `feat(api): create FastAPI endpoint for model inference`

*   **Commit 15: Containerize the Inference API**
    *   **Task:** Create an optimized, production-ready `api/Dockerfile`.
    *   **Commit Message:** `feat(ops): add production Dockerfile for inference API`

*   **Commit 16: Implement CI/CD with GitHub Actions**
    *   **Task:** Create a `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file to test and build the API container automatically.
    *   **Commit Message:** `feat(ops): implement CI pipeline with GitHub Actions`

### **Module 5: Scientific Rigor & The Interview Gauntlet**

*   **AI's Role for this Module:** Act as my research advisor and mock interviewer. For ablation studies, help me formulate a clear, testable hypothesis. For the LeetCode solutions, review my code and ask, "What is the time and space complexity? Can you think of a more optimal solution?"

*   **Commit 17: The Ablation Studies**
    *   **Task:** Use Git branches to conduct and document ablation studies in `docs/04_experiments.md`.
    *   **Commit Message:** `docs: add results and analysis from all ablation studies`

*   **Commit 18: The LeetCode Gauntlet (DS&A Integration)**
    *   **Task:** Create the `leetcode/` directory and populate it with my solutions, organized by topic.
    *   **Commit Message:** `feat(interview): add curated solutions to classic DS&A problems`

*   **Commit 19: The Final Showcase**
    *   **Task:** Train the final model and update the `README.md` to be the ultimate project hub, linking to all artifacts and documentation.
    *   **Commit Message:** `docs: create final project showcase in README`
